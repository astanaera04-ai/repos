/**
 * ===========================================================================
 *  WORKED EXAMPLE -- read this file before you write anything.
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * This is one finished waiting room, and it is the only one you are given.
 * It shows you three things you will need for your own three:
 *
 *   1. what implementing WaitingRoom looks like -- four methods, nothing else;
 *   2. how a dynamic array grows (question 2 of the report is about this code);
 *   3. that every ordering decision goes through Patient.before, never
 *      through a severity comparison you write yourself.
 *
 * This room is also a TRUSTED REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION: it follows the same rule as
 * your SortedListRoom and your HeapRoom, so all three must call patients in exactly
 * the same order. When your two disagree with this one, look for the mistake in
 * your own code first -- but "trusted" is not "infallible by definition": if you
 * genuinely believe you found a bug here, say so at the defense and show why.
 *
 * The idea: pile the patients up in any order and do nothing on arrival.
 * The search happens when the doctor asks, and it looks at everybody.
